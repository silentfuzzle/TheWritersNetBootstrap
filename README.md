#The Writer's Net

----

The Writer’s Net is a website for reading, writing, and sharing non-linear fiction. Users should be able to create their own books, format page contents with markdown, and link pages together with hyperlinks using the website’s editor. Books with a public visibility should be available in the website’s library for others to read, rate, and review. The website should also provide tools such as a map and web-browser-like Back and Forward buttons to help readers navigate the text and track their position and progress.
